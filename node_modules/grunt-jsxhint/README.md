> Like [grunt-contrib-jshint](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint) but compatible with [react's](https://github.com/facebook/react) jsx

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-jsxhint --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-jsxhint');
```

## Jshint task
This grunt plugin works exactly like [grunt-contrib-jshint](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint). In fact it's even using `grunt-contrib-jshint`. The only difference to `grunt-contrib-jshint` is that this plugin runs `require('bable-core').transform(code, {plugins: ["transform-react-jsx"]});` on every file passed in. This will transform the jsx syntax to regular JavaScript. Non jsx-files will be unchanged. Line numbers are preserved by jsx so the line numbers outputted by jshint will be correct.

This is a drop in replacement for `grunt-contrib-jshint`. So you can just replace the `grunt-contrib-jshint` dependency in your `package.json` with `grunt-jsxhint`.

`grunt-jsxhint` needs `bable-core` and `babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx` to work. If you don't have either installed run

```shell
npm install babel-core babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx --save-dev
```


Use exactly like `grunt-contrib-jshint`:


```js
jshint: {
  //Everything like in grunt-contrib-jshint
}
```

## Parsed filed extensions
By default, your jsx files need to have a `.jsx` or `.react.js` file extension. In order to parse other files, add the following into your jshint options object:

```js
jshint: {
    options: {
        jshintrc: '.jshintrc',
        ignores: [],
        additionalSuffixes: ['.js']
    },
}
```

These suffixes are concatenated onto .jsx and .react.js.
